## Privacy

TickerTape respects your privacy. TickerTape is open source, and always will be. TickerTape
will never track you, or sell or share your data. TickerTape offers in-app purchases which you
may purchase to support the developer. These purchases are never required to use the application
or any features.

**PLEASE NOTE:** TickerTape is **not a fully FOSS application.** This is due to the fact that it
relies on a proprietary In-App Billing library for in-app purchases in order to stay policy
compliant with the leading marketplace.


## Development

TickerTape is developed in the open on GitHub at:  

```
https://github.com/pyamsoft/home-button
```

If you know a few things about Android programming and are wanting to help
out with development you can do so by creating issue tickets to squash bugs,
and propose feature requests for future inclusion.


# Issues or Questions

Please post any issues with the code in the Issues section on GitHub. Pull Requests
will be accepted on GitHub only after extensive reading and as long as the request
goes in line with the design of the application.
